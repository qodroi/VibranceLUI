# VibranceLUI (Beta)

Control Nvidia's Digital Vibrance on Linux systems with this tool, with option to affect all displays or just the main one, as well as turning Vibrance only within a specific application.

Note that this tool isn't finished and is currently in beta status, this means that certain features aren't implemented yet, that bugs may exist, memory leaks, and inefficient code

Credit to [VibranceGUI](https://github.com/juv/vibranceGUI) for the inspiration.
